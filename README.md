# basicCalculator
Very basic calculator made in Python

This is a calculator that can solve basic arithmetic equations (add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers) and find the area of a circle, square, triangle, or trapezoid. The prompts given are in natural language, and you'll have to type in your response one at a time as the calculator asks.

Again, this is just a basic calculator I made as a test project with nothing serious in mind.
